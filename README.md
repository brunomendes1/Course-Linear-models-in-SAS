# My-course-on-Linear-models-wit-h SAS

This was a course on using standard linear models in SAS.
Each one of the files contains SAS code that analyses a particular data set using a particular model.

Most of the examples are from some of the books below:

Applied Regression Analysis and other multivariate methods, Kleinbaum, Kupper, Nizam
and Muller, 4th Edition, Thompson Brooks/Cole. Best theory explanations of the three
books I've mentioned so far (but not completely thorough), and SAS examples (no code on
the book itself).

SAS for Data Analysis. Intermediate Statistical Methods, Marasinghe and Kennedy,
Springer, 2008. Excellent introduction to SAS and code examples in the book, unfortunately
it stops at 2-way ANOVA with mixed eects. Explanation of theory is succinct, but more
complete and clear than the SAS book above.

The books below are more thorough theoretically but have no SAS code:
